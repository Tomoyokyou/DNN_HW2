We presented a sparse representation based approach for occlusion invariant face hallucination. Our proposed scheme extends robust sparse coding for determining the optimal parameter automatically. As a result, non-occluded image regions can be recovered from the LR inputs, while their corresponding HR versions can be synthesized accordingly. The above coding and learning process is based on maximum likelihood estimation, and thus no user interaction or parameter tuning is required. Experimental results on both face hallucination and the LR-to-HR face recognition tasks confirmed the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.
%In this work, we propose a novel method to improve the performance of RSC through masking out the appropriate occluded region in the query image, and therefore preventing the clean pixels to be interfered. Our method not only improves the hallucination results, but also aids in the performance of face recognition task.
