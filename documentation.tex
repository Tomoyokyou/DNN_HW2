\section{Environment}
We recommend Linux platform to run this program, source file are written in C,however C++ compiler is also needed to run other programs.
\section{Makefile}
For simplicity, type "make" at main directory, then enter "sh train.sh" to run structured SVM.
Detailed makefile command are listed as follows:
\subsubsection*{all:}
 compile structured SVM programs and some useful programs preparing SVM features.
\subsubsection*{structSvm:}
 compile structured SVM api program.
\subsubsection*{svmGen:}
 merge features and labels together. 
\subsubsection*{featNorm:}
 normalize features to zero mean, unit variance.
\subsubsection*{svmTrim:}
 trimming predicted label sequence.
\subsubsection*{makeFrameData:}
 splice features to take frame sequence into account.
\subsubsection*{clean:}
 remove objects and executables
\section{Files \& Directories}
This is a modification from a package source, so we only list the files which are the core of this program.  
\subsection{Directories}
\subsubsection*{svm\_ struct:}
contains structured SVM api source files.
\subsubsection*{example:}
all source files related to features are in this directory.
\subsubsection*{bin:}
compiled executables are in this directory.
\subsubsection*{model:}
structured SVM model directory, weight sequence of psi dimensions, build automatically while compiling this program

\subsection{Source files}
\subsubsection*{svm\_struct/src/svm\_struct\_api.c:}
the api interface, this is the main work for HW2, for example, find\_most\_violated\_constraint, psi function, etc.
\subsubsection*{svm\_struct/include/svm\_struct\_api\_type.h:}
most struct definition are written in this file.
\subsection{Script files}
We prepared some shell scripts for you to run this program easily, you can modify parameters in these scripts to do any experiment you want.
\subsubsection*{train.sh:}
type "sh train.sh" then it will begin to train structured SVM model, if features path are given correctly.
\subsubsection*{test.sh:}
type "sh test.sh" to classify testing feature, then the result of this will be trimmed.
