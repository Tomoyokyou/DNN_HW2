We presented a face hallucination method that is able to deal with occlusion. In particular, we proposed a mechanism for robust sparse coding to determine the optimal parameter for detecting the occluded part from the input image. As a result, the proposed method could automatically recognize the occluded part of the input image without parameter tuning. Experimental results on the face hallucination and the LR-to-HR face recognition problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
%In this work, we propose a novel method to improve the performance of RSC through masking out the appropriate occluded region in the query image, and therefore preventing the clean pixels to be interfered. Our method not only improves the hallucination results, but also aids in the performance of face recognition task.
