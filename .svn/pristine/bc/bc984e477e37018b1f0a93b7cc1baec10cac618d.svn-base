\begin{abstract}
Since low-resolution(LR) image captured by the surveillance system can be noisy and even occluded by masks or sunglasses, directly using traditional methods to reconstruct high-resolution(HR) image may lead to unnatural effects which are not tolerable. In this paper, we proposed a face hallucination method that could handle those occlusions with no occluded training data or prior knowledge of occlusions needed in advance. This is achieved by using adaptive robust sparse coding to distinguish the occluded regions and then using position-patch based face hallucination method to synthesize interested non-occluded regions. Experimental result demonstrates that our HR image has not only better overall PSNR and SSIM but also better image quality in local non-occluded areas. Further, by ignoring occluded areas, we can achieve a better performance in the extended long distance recognition problem than some other state-of-the-art methods.
%Matching individuals across non-overlapping camera views is known as the problem of person re-identification. In addition to significant visual appearance variations due to lighting, view angle, etc. changes, one might encounter corrupted data due to background clutter and occlusion, or even missing data at some camera views in practical scenarios. To address the above challenges, we present a novel approach to robust person re-identification, particularly aiming at handling missing and corrupted image data across camera views. Based on the technique of low-rank matrix decomposition, our proposed algorithm observes the low-rank structure of cross-view data, which is able to disregard extreme/sparse errors while the missing instances can be recovered automatically. Our experiments will confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our method, which is shown to outperform several baseline and state-of-the-art person re-identification approaches.


%Instead of relying on prevailing linearization, coarse-to-fine warping, and descriptor-based matching techniques to estimate large motion on two consecutive frames,  we use gradient descend to jointly minimize both data term and smoothness term in the proposed energy function at superpixel-level. We found that optimizing data term could be treated as doing the mean-shift tracking on all superpixels simultaneously. Moreover, by using anisotropic nonlocal smoothness term which passes matching information within the same object, we greatly alleviates local minimum problem which troubles many other optical flow algorithms. Finally, an promising experiment results demonstrate our method as an effective new type of way to solve large displacement optical flow problem.

%Illustrations must appear within the designated margins.  They may span the two columns.  If possible, \textbf{position illustrations at the top of columns}, rather than in the middle or at the bottom.  Caption and number every illustration. All halftone illustrations must be clear black and white prints.  Colors may be used, but they should be selected so as to be \textbf{readable when printed on a black-only printer}. Since there are many ways, often incompatible, of including images (e.g., with experimental results) in a LaTeX document, below is an example of how to do this
